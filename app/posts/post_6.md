If this sounds like you. You are not alone. A lot of students want to continue with *FIRST* Robotics once they finish High School and go on to college. And there are ways to do that at many colleges around the world as a lot of them mentor *FIRST* Robotics teams. As an example, WPI mentors team 190, RPI guides team 20 and RIT offers support to team 73. RIT students participate in *FIRST* Robotics through their club, [RIT *FIRST*](https://sites.sg.rit.edu/ritfirst/frc/), which meets every Wednesday at 7pm in Gleason 2159.  

Some *FIRST* Robotics alumni, current RIT students, decided to venture away from *FIRST* and try their luck at [BattleBots](http://www.battlebots.com/). They formed the “Blindside Robotics” team which competed in California this year as the second college team next to MIT.  

As one of the team members [said](https://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=54904): “We are by far one of the youngest teams in the entire competition, going up against professional builders who have decades of experience beyond us”

# Build Season
*Posted by **Patrick Kubiak** on December 8, 2016*  

The *FIRST* Robotics build season is an intense six weeks of designing, building, and testing a robot. Teams are challenged to build their robot from a [Kit of Parts](http://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/2016-kit-of-parts) with very limited instructions.

Each year the season starts with a Kickoff event broadcasted live all over the world on the first Saturday of the year. Dean Kamen and Woodie Flowers, with the help of others, reveal the challenges and objectives of this year's game. You can watch last season's kickoff below.

Teams gather at different sites to watch the broadcast. Some at bigger events at local universities which host the kickoff for the area teams and some, like Team 1991 hold their own events. Every year University of Hartford opens its doors to our team to have a kickoff party. Mentors, parents and students gather in the auditorium and watch the broadcast. Itâ€™s a great time for socializing and welcoming freshman to the team.  

Right after the game reveal broadcast, the team opens a package from *FIRST* which contains the new Kit of Parts made up of motors, batteries, a control system, construction materials and software registration details. This is where the fun begins...  

Right after the kickoff live stream, the team discusses strategies and comes up with prototype robot designs. For efficiency and time management, the team is divided into subgroups, each working on a different part of the robot. Thus, there is a design group working on possible design solutions and prototyping in SoildWorks.

The mechanical group builds the actual components of the robot, and the programming group spends their time coding for the robot. The goal is to complete the robot before the end of the six weeks, so that there is enough time for testing and driver practice. To accomplish that, students work 3 to 6 hours every day after school, as well as all days on weekends. Time increases as the deadline approaches. It is not uncommon for some students to work till midnight the last week of the build season. As long as there are adult members willing to stay that long, the students will too.

At the end of six weeks, teams must bag up their robots and are not allowed to work on them until the day of the [competition](#/post/5/).

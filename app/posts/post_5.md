# The Competition
*Posted by **Patrick Kubiak** on December 10, 2016*  

At the culmination of the build season, each team attends regional competitions that take place at different sites all over the world.  

The day before the competition the teams have the opportunity to take their robots to the site, unbag it and set up their pit. At each competition, there is an area designated as a pit for each team to use as their home base, where they keep their robot and all of their tools. In the pits, teams fine tune their robots and repair broken parts in between matches. Each teams’ pit crew is responsible for the operation of the robot on the field.

Regional competitions are usually two days long. On the first day, teams compete in qualification matches. Teams play on randomly assigned alliances of three robots, each scoring points. Each match begins with a 15-second autonomous period, where the robots follow pre-programmed instructions and have no human input. This is a challenging task, and not every team is able to program their robot well enough to gain valuable points available during this time. After autonomous, “drivers” gain control of the robot. Standing behind a plexiglass window, with hands on the joysticks, they steer the robot though obstacles, trying to score points by performing the tasks specific to the year’s game. As you can imagine, this is not an easy task. A lot depends on the driver’s skills. The best designed robot will not score any points, nor will they win the game if the driver fails to perform.

The qualification matches end before lunch on the second day of the competition. Teams are ranked based on their individual performances. The top eight ranked teams are the actors in the alliance selection, a turning point in the competition.

During alliance selection, the top eight teams each choose two more teams to form an alliance to compete in the playoffs. The playoffs are single elimination best of 3 matches. Four alliances move on to the semifinals, and the top two alliances fight in the final to determine the winner of the event.  

Choosing the right teams for your alliance is extremely important, as well as being chosen to be a part of an alliance. It may determine team’s odds of winning. Because a large part of success in competitions is based on the alliances that are selected before eliminations, scouting and building relationships with other teams is extremely important. During the competition, the scouting group talks to individual teams about their robot and seeks to build relationships with other teams at a competition. Using a computer app, scouters also record and analyze data about teams to find the most compatible team to form an alliance for the finals.  

From the regionals, the winning alliance of three teams goes on to the district competition, where matches are played in the same manner as at the regionals. From the district competitions held all over the world, the winning teams continue on to the World Championship held in St Lois, Missouri.  

Not all teams have to win the district competition to go to St Lois. Some teams get an automatic entry to the World Championship. These include all the teams that won the prestigious Chairman’s Award, the current and previous year Rookie All-Star Award Winners, Engineering Inspiration Award winners and First Championship winners from the previous year. For each year a team doesn’t make it to Worlds, they get an entry into a random drawing. My team, Dragons 1991, made the trip to St. Lois last year through the wild card selection.

# And Second. What is FRC?

FRC stands for *FIRST* Robotics Competition.

*FIRST* refers to the *FIRST* Robotics Competition as a “Varsity Sport for the Mind” that “combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology”.

In the *FIRST* Robotics Competition, teams of High School students are given six weeks to design, build and program a robot capable of playing a challenging game against other robots. The games change every year, but always certain things remain the same: two alliances of three robots each compete against each other on a small, enclosed field roughly the size of a miniature basketball court. The robots are based off of common kits to which teams add their own modifications and designs.
Teams then have six weeks to conceive, design, and build their robots, which are then sent out to at least one of 57 Regionals across the world. Then, at Regionals, they'll compete against a field of dozens for the chance to qualify for the Championship in St. Lois.

But the competition isn't the point of *FIRST*, or rather, it's a means, not an end. *FIRST* is not just about building robots. Robots are nothing but the vehicles. Vehicles to exploring science, engineering and technology.

The point of *FIRST* is to "promote a philosophy of teamwork and collaboration among engineers and encourage competing teams to remain friendly, helping each other out when necessary", in addition to getting students excited about science and technology. And boy, do they get excited! Trust me, you haven't seen excited until you've seen 6,000 students in an arena, dressed and painted in their team colors, banging away on noisemakers, screaming themselves hoarse with chants, with every emotion they have riding on the backs of the robots they've built.

*FIRST* might just be the best opportunity for aspiring techies to learn not just how to wield a soldering iron but how to interact with others in the spirit of "gracious professionalism." The spirit of "coopertition" that *FIRST* indoctrinates among its participants - students working hard, working smart, collaborating well, and tempering their technical, interpersonal, and leadership skills under a healthy, educational, and beneficent duress.

What *FIRST* does is help inspire students to pursue careers in engineering, science, and technology; to endow them with the time-management and prioritization skills that will make them successful competitors in any field; and to develop in them the collaborative spirit that will make them a success in any interpersonal endeavor.

FRC stands for *FIRST* Robotics Competition.

*FIRST* refers to the *FIRST* Robotics Competition as a “Varsity Sport for the Mind” that “combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology”.

In the First Robotics Competition teams of high school students are given six weeks to design, construct and program a robot capable of playing a challenging game against other robots in regional and national events. This closely mimics the real-life challenges engineers face when working on projects.  

Challenges vary greatly from year to year. For example, in 2013 the objective was to build a robot capable of collecting Frisbees and shooting them into goals of varying heights. Climbing a three story pyramid at the end of the match earned the team bonus points. In 2014, teams were asked to build robots that could throw a massive inflatable exercise ball five feet into the air and over a truss. In 2015, the challenge was to build a robotic forklift that could create a tower of up to six totes and top it off with a recycling bin with a pool noodle in it. In 2016, the competition adopted a medieval theme, with teams competing to build robots that could cross medieval defenses, such as a portcullis or a moat, shoot boulders at a tower, and scale a tower at the end. These are all different challenges, but what they all have in common is an intense six week period to build a robot, and the excitement of the competition.  

Even though the game is different every year, certain elements remain the same. There are always two alliances of three robots each competing against each other on a small, enclosed field. The robots are build using common kits to which each team adds its own modifications and designs.   

But according to Dean Kamen, the competition is not about robots. *FIRST* is not just about building robots. Robots are nothing but the vehicles; vehicles to exploring science, engineering and technology.

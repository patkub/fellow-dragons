*FIRST* refers to the *FIRST* Robotics Competition as a “Varsity Sport for the Mind” that “combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology”.  

In the First Robotics Competition teams of high school students are given six weeks to design, construct and program a robot capable of playing a challenging game against other robots in regional and national events. This closely mimics the real-life challenges engineers face when working on the projects.  

Even though the game is different every year, certain elements remain the same. There are always two alliances of three robots each competing against each other on a small, enclosed field. The robots are based off of common kits to which each team adds its own modifications and designs.  

The event is as exciting as any sports event can be with hoards of kids dressed and painted in their team colors, banging away on noisemakers, screaming themselves hoarse with chants, dancing “cupid shuffle” and “cha-cha slide”.
But the competition is not about robots according to Dean Kamen. *FIRST* is not just about building robots. Robots are nothing but the vehicles, vehicles to exploring science, engineering and technology.

# *FIRST* Robotics

Before starting high school I never even heard about *FIRST* Robotics. Even though I have been building robots ever since I could walk, I have not heard about high school kids building robots. And not just building any robots, but robots that compete and play matches. Obviously, I am slightly exaggerating with when I got involved into robot creation, but I started with Lego Mindstorms pretty early. My robots were simple and miniature compared to what gets built by *FIRST* Robotics teams in high schools all around the world. But before I talk about that more, let’s start from the beginning…

# FIRST things FIRST. What is *FIRST*?

*FIRST* is an acronym: For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology

*FIRST* is a non-profit organization founded by inventor Dean Kamen in 1989. Kamen, who is known for inventing the first portable insulin pump and Segway, began *FIRST* to get kids excited by math and engineering the same way kids are excited about sports.

The mission of *FIRST* is to inspire young students to pursue science, engineering and technology careers. *FIRST* does this by engaging students in mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills and fostering self-confidence, communication and leadership skills.

> "To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders."  
--Dean Kamen

Dean Kamen's goal is to popularize math and science the same way sports popularize athletics. He does that through FRC.

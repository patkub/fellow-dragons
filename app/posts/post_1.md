# *FIRST* Robotics

Before starting high school I never even heard about *FIRST* Robotics. Even though I have been building robots ever since I could walk, I have not heard about high school kids building robots. And not just building any robots, but robots that compete and play matches. Obviously, I am slightly exaggerating with when I got involved into robot creation, but I started with Lego Mindstorms pretty early. My robots were simple and miniature compared to what gets built by *FIRST* Robotics teams in high schools all around the world. But before I talk about that more, let’s start from the beginning…

# *FIRST* things *FIRST*. What is *FIRST*?

*FIRST* is an acronym: For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology

*FIRST* is a not-for-profit organization founded by inventor Dean Kamen in 1989. Kamen, who is known for inventing the *FIRST* portable insulin pump and Segway, began *FIRST* to get kids excited about math and engineering. The mission of *FIRST* is to inspire young students to pursue science, engineering and technology careers. *FIRST* does this by engaging students in mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills and fostering self-confidence, communication and leadership skills.

# And Second. What is FRC?

FRC stands for *FIRST* Robotics Competition. The *FIRST* robotics competition challenges teams of high school students to design a robot within six weeks time frame. In January each team begins with a kit of parts and a challenge to built a robot that can compete and win. *FIRST* in local competitions and then in regionals. Do well in regionals and the team qualifies for the world championships.

The game is played by two competing alliances of three robots each. The objective is to score the most points to advance to the next level. Dean Kamen's goal with FRC and all of the *FIRST* competitions is to popularize math and science the same way sports popularize athletics. Competitions are set in large arenas with intense two minute matches and hundreds of people cheering each other on, competition is as close as you get to a STEM Olympics. And these six weeks sleepless nights starts off with a bang on the NASA channel, *FIRST* Robotics Kickoff!

Every year the game is setup in two alliances of three teams each going head to head for a few minutes. The game is also broken up into 3 sections, autonomous (where the robot is acting off of programming alone and scoring is worth double), teleoperated (where the drivers are controlling the robot's actions) and end-game (where a special end game is setup in the last few seconds for extra points).

Every year, in January, a team of engineers on the Game Design Committee unveil that year's game to the 37,000+ students on 3,000+ teams in 12 countries worldwide. The games change every year, but always certain things remain the same: two alliances of three robots each compete against each other on a small, enclosed field, roughly the size of a small basketball court. The robots are based off of common kits to which teams add their own modifications and designs (subject to a sort of "salary cap" meant to mitigate economic, rather than engineering, advantages). Teams then have six weeks to conceive, design, and build their robots, which are then sent out to at least one of 57 Regionals across the world. Then, at Regionals, they'll compete against a field of dozens for the chance to qualify for the Championship Event in St. Lois.

But the competition isn't the point of *FIRST*, or rather, it's a means, not an end. The point of *FIRST* is to "promote a philosophy of teamwork and collaboration among engineers and encourages competing teams to remain friendly, helping each other out when necessary", in addition to getting students excited about science and technology.

And boy, do they get excited. Trust me, you haven't seen excited until you've seen 6,000 students in an arena, dressed and painted in their team colors, banging away on noisemakers, screaming themselves hoarse with chants, with every emotion they have riding on the backs of the robots they've built. I'm not posting a competition video here because a grainy 480x360 video can't do it justice - you need to go to a regional event and see for yourself.

*FIRST* might just be the best opportunity for aspiring techies to learn not just how to wield a soldering iron but how to interact with others in the spirit of "Gracious Professionalism." The spirit of "Coopertition" that *FIRST* indoctrinates among its participants - students working hard, working smart, collaborating well, and tempering their technical, interpersonal, and leadership skills under a healthy, educational, and beneficent duress.

What *FIRST* does is help inspire students to pursue careers in engineering, science, and technology; to endow them with the time-management and prioritization skills that will make them successful competitors in any field; and to develop in them the collaborative spirit that will make them a success in any interpersonal endeavor.

*FIRST* is not just about building robots. Robots are nothing but the vehicles. Vehicles to exploring science, engineering and technology.

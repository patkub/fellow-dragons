# *FIRST* Robotics

Before starting high school I never even heard about *FIRST* Robotics. Even though I have been building robots ever since I could walk, I have not heard about high school kids building robots. And not just building any robots, but robots that compete and play matches. Obviously, I am slightly exaggerating with when I got involved into robot creation, but I started with Lego Mindstorms pretty early. My robots were simple and miniature compared to what gets built by *FIRST* Robotics teams in high schools all around the world. But before I talk about that more, let’s start from the beginning…

# FIRST things FIRST. What is *FIRST*?

*FIRST* is an organization which was founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway Human Transporter, the first portable insulin pump, and (most recently) the Slingshot water purifier. Kamen’s idea is to get kids excited about math and engineering the same way they are excited about sports. He wants *FIRST* to inspire young students to pursue science, engineering and technology careers. *FIRST* does this by engaging students in programs that build science, engineering and technology skills as well as foster self-confidence, communication and leadership skills.

*FIRST* is comprised of four programs:  *FIRST* LEGO League Junior for ages 6-9, *FIRST* LEGO League for ages 9-14, *FIRST* Tech Challenge for grades 7-12, and *FIRST* Robotics Competition for high school students.

Dean Kamen's goal is use these programs to popularize math and science the same way sports popularize athletics.
